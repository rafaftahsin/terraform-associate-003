## Preparing for the exam

The Terraform Associate 003 exam has both a [study guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-study-003) and a [review guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-review-003). While much of the information in these two guides are the same, they are presented differently for different uses. Use the [study guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-study-003) if you want to study all the exam objectives. Use the [review guide](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-review-003) if you already have Terraform experience and/or training and want to pick and choose which objectives to review before taking the exam. There are also [sample questions](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/certification-003/associate-questions) available so you can get a feel for what the exam will be like.
